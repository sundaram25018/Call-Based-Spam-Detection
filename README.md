# Audio-Based Spam Detection
Audio-Based Spam Detection is an advanced technique used to identify and filter spam or malicious content present in audio data. With the rise of voice-based communication channels such as voicemails, voice assistants, and social media platforms, spammers have extended their tactics to include audio messages. This technology leverages speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to analyze and classify audio recordings as legitimate or spam.

# Audio Transcription:

The first step involves converting spoken words in audio files into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tools like Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, or others.
This transcription provides the textual data required for further processing.
# Preprocessing:

The transcribed text is cleaned by removing noise such as filler words, punctuation, and stopwords.
Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization are applied to normalize the text.
# Feature Extraction:

Text features like word frequencies, sentiment scores, and keywords are extracted using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Contextual embeddings from models like BERT can also be used for deeper semantic understanding.
# Classification:

A machine learning or deep learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) is trained on labeled datasets to classify the text as spam or not spam.
The model can also be tailored to detect specific types of spam, such as phishing attempts or advertisements.

After analysis, the system provides feedback, such as:
"Spam Alert": Indicates that the audio contains potentially malicious content.
"Legitimate Message": Indicates that the audio is safe.
